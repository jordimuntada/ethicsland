            <p>I am curious about how deeply ingrained the roots of human dogmatism must be to ingest animal flesh.</p>
            <p>Imagination and reasoning can help clarify why you or others believe in this commonly seeded idea.</p>
            <p>WHAT IF you were disgusted by the taste of meat?</p>
            <p>I know you love the taste of meat.</p>
            <p>But.</p>
            <p>What if you weren’t fond of eating meat because of its taste?</p>
            <p>Would you still consume animal flesh because they say it is the way ancient humans in the past based their diets?</p>
            <p>Even though you knew it is avoidable and you could feed on other sources of food, would you still eat meat?</p>
            <p>I like the taste of meat. I love eating meat. Even though I no longer put animal flesh in my mouth and digest it, I acknowledge I like it, and so, I choose not to eat meat. I morally know it is wrong to exploit and abuse animals for my benefit, so I try to do what is in my hands to reduce my pain footprint by not buying animal-based products. It is as simple as that. I don’t buy animal-based products anymore, and I base my diet on the science-based information I find on the Internet.</p>
            <p>Now, this thought-provoking mental exercise is a way to discern your true reasons for choice. Before this reasoning, you cannot hide behind hypocrisy.</p>
            <p>A lot of hypocrisy is supported by social validation. Huge numbers of people approve of this standpoint.</p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>Because then they don’t have to question their own choices.</p>
            <p>You have to understand that most people don’t want animal suffering. Individuals want to live without harming others, but cognitive dissonance, social approval, fear, and commodity are powerful enough to constrain human action.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, people are still responsible for the actions they choose to take.</p>
            <p>Data is out there.</p>
            <p>The internet is full of information with scientific validation. But any sense of life change pushes actions sideways. People don’t want to change.</p>
            <p>Habits are deeply rooted in toxic high-dopamine short-term social approval.</p>
            <p>Anyway, you wouldn’t follow your ancestors in their diet if you were disgusted by meat and had diet alternatives.</p>
            <p>So, don’t lie to yourself and take action.</p>
            <p>You won’t change in terms of political viewpoints, or dress codes, or in human values, or in social economics.</p>
            <p>Be wise, be just.</p>

        <p>Exploring the Conflict Between Our Values and Actions in Everyday Decisions</p>
        <p>Humans are full of inconsistencies. Inconsistency is part of what defines being human.</p>
        <p>However, since time immemorial, we have somehow tried to fight against these inconsistencies. Although sometimes I think we even make them bigger.</p>
        <p>But without straying from the subject at hand, yes, we are captains of inconsistencies. We are inconsistency on legs.</p>
        <p>So, cognitive dissonance could be a type of inconsistency. I’m not going to grade it or categorize it, but we experience it daily.</p>
        <p>And there is one in particular that causes the greatest suffering that has ever existed on Earth.</p>
        <p>Some examples of cognitive dissonance are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Smoking knowing it is harmful to health: Many people who smoke are aware of the damage tobacco can cause to their health. However, they continue to smoke. This contradiction between knowledge of health risks and the behavior of continuing to smoke could be cognitive dissonance.</li>
            <li>Eating unhealthy, high-calorie foods while trying to lose weight: People trying to lose weight know they should eat healthily. However, they sometimes opt for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. The contradiction between the desire to lose weight and the consumption of unhealthy, high-calorie foods generates cognitive dissonance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, there is a cognitive dissonance that most humans suffer from, and it leads to, for example, the throats of newly born calves being slit. I could say, live chicks being ground up alive. I could say, caging sows that are nothing more than biological machines forced to reproduce indefinitely until, when the sow’s infertility is satiated, humans financed by your money slaughter them to make sausages out of them.</p>
        <p>Well, this cognitive dissonance is not something external to you, it is not something you cannot control, it is something you decide to live with, it is something you choose, it is something you decide to live with, it is something that defines you because it is your decisions and actions that define you.</p>
        <p>But, wait!! Why is it a cognitive dissonance?</p>
        <p>Well, because you want to act like a good person, you want to make good, fair, moral decisions, you want to see yourself as a person who looks out for protecting the vulnerable, and fighting against suffering. Because you don’t want to accept that sausages, ham, animal leather shoes, cheese, and a host of products that you consume, are the product of unfair decisions, that even though you want to feed yourself and your loved ones, you have alternatives, but no, you choose what you choose.</p>
        <p>You choose to cause suffering that is perfectly avoidable.</p>
        <p>So, what is the theory of cognitive dissonance?</p>
        <p>Well, look, When a dissonance occurs, an inconsistency between what we think and how we act, we perceive a tension and a lack of harmony that automatically motivates us to resolve it to return to a state of internal coherence.</p>
        <p>To do this we have two paths:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>change our behavior to match our values, or</li>
            <li>change our values to match our behavior.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, which one are you living with regarding your lifestyle and animal exploitation?</p>

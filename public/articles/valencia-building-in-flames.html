            <p>As far as I'm aware, animals possess a greater innocence compared to humans.</p>

            <p>Despite the injustices present in our society, the injustices animals face from humans are more profound and severe.</p>

            <p>To me, the injustices animals endure in society are worse.</p>

            <p>Why is this?</p>

            <p>Consider that humans benefit from the use of resources, pleasures, rights, services, and protection that they themselves have created and offered within society.</p>

            <p>However, animals have not chosen to integrate into human society.</p>

            <p>They prefer to exist within their own communities. This isn't to say they possess the cognitive ability to decide or reason to the extent of articulating a desire to remain separate from human society.</p>

            <p>While some animals might benefit from interactions with humans and our societal systems, it certainly isn't a choice they've made consciously.</p>

            <p>A week ago, in Valencia, Spain, a fire engulfed an entire building, leaving it charred.</p>

            <p>Tragically, 40 dogs and 30 cats perished, whereas, it appears, fewer than 15 humans lost their lives.</p>

            <p>It seems the humans were likely out, working, while the pets were at home, awaiting their return.</p>

            <p>In such instances, it's perhaps surprising or not, but I find myself more profoundly affected by the news of 70 animals dying than by the death of up to fifteen humans.</p>

            <p>Of course, I am deeply saddened by the loss of human life. However, those individuals chose to live in that building and, as humans, benefited from societal advantages.</p>

            <p>In contrast, those animals never chose to be in that situation. They didn't decide to live in that building, yet found themselves involuntarily confined within those walls, eventually succumbing to the smoke and flames.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, the human casualty count was lower (and I am, of course, sorry for those losses) because many pet owners were out, working at the time.</p>

            <p>Thus, my tears flowed more readily for the animals than for the humans.</p>

            <p>I am deeply sorry for all the lives lost, but the image of the dogs and cats effectively trapped in their homes haunts me.</p>

            <p>I recognize the importance of choosing our words carefully. They weren't "imprisoned" in the strictest sense, yet in some ways, they were. Despite our best intentions and kindest actions, they were confined.</p>

            <p>I am aware that I confine my own dogs.</p>

            <p>Why?</p>

            <p>They are unable to survive independently in the urban environment where we live, and their biology has largely adapted to coexist with humans.</p>

            <p>This realization compels me to strive to be a better person, a more responsible dog owner, a kinder companion to my pets, and more compassionate towards other animals.</p>

            <p>I detest the notion of victimhood.</p>

            <p>I acknowledge the existence of numerous victims in the world.</p>

            <p>However, I am also cognizant of individuals who portray themselves as victims or who are perceived as such by society for personal gain.</p>

            <p>This observation disturbs me greatly.</p>

            <p>Thus, I cannot tolerate self-victimization.</p>

            <p>In the case of the dogs and cats, they were true victims.</p>

            <p>Invoking my naive philosophical perspective, I would argue that the non-human inhabitants of that building were more victimized than the humans.</p>

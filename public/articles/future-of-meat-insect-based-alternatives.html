        <p>Yes, it’s been a few years since I’ve been hearing on and on that the future of meat is bug-based or insect-based.</p>
        <p>Yes, it is high-protein meat, with almost no cholesterol and highly nutritious, and also low-energy consuming. It requires fewer resources (land and feed) to produce insects, which means producing food rich in protein.</p>
        <p>But, it is still exploitation-based meat and pain-based meat too, and furthermore, there’s the simple plant-based diet solution.</p>
        <p>I struggle to understand why there’s a shift to bugs, and not a shift to full plants. I still struggle to understand why people can’t stick with plants. Just eat plants. Eat what grows from the land and that’s it. Why not?</p>
        <p>You might empathize less with an insect. I might struggle to feel emotionally connected to the pain that an insect can suffer. Yet, I can rationalize that they have a nervous system and a brain at their disposal, which means they feel pain. And I can reason in such a way that I connect the dots: if I eat insects, they are killed. They are killed unnecessarily because I can live on plant protein. If they are killed unnecessarily, they are exploited unnecessarily. If all these dots are connected and they are true, then it is immoral to eat insect-based meat.</p>
        <p>It is amazing how humans can look for alternatives other than plants to live on. I don’t know if this is to not acknowledge the truth, not to support the plant-based diet lifestyle, to behave like a child whose intentions are always against, and then seek attention, which results in positive reinforcement because it triggers dopamine.</p>
        <p>Beware that receiving attention of any kind usually reinforces behavior. It doesn’t matter if you act benevolently or evilly to draw attention; many times this carries positive reinforcement with it, which feels kind of good.</p>
        <p>By the way, the vast majority of adults are kids with more hair and a different voice. That’s all.</p>
        <p>Either way, that’s my reflection on listening once in a while, and too often, that the future of meat is bug-based.</p>

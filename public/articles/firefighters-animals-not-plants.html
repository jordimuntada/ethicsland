        <p>Have you ever noticed that firefighters never go for the plants?</p>
        <p>Have you noticed that firefighters never save plants?</p>
        <p>Why? Why is that?</p>
        <p>How is it that people passionately defend plants against animals during a subtle, occasional, and peaceful lunch conversation, which ultimately turns into a debate? But then, the people who truly put their lives in danger to save others don’t hesitate to not enter a burning house to rescue the plants within.</p>
        <p>People, when sitting at a table, can often display egocentric, non-reflective, and unempathetic behavior, especially when they don’t have to face real-life challenges.</p>
        <p>Humans tend to advocate for their beliefs, even if doing so goes against logic and reasoning. This tendency exists because we are resistant to change initially. Besides the mental effort required to consider new perspectives and ideas, it also makes us feel more vulnerable, although in reality, it’s quite the opposite. This flexibility conveys intelligence and, above all, confidence.</p>
        <p>Being capable of adapting to new ways of thinking when you’re wrong, recognizing your mistakes, and humbly admitting your faults in pursuit of positive change is a virtue and an act of bravery.</p>
        <p>Embrace change in life and be courageous.</p>
        <p>But wait, why don’t firefighters save plants in danger? Well, because firefighters know that plants can’t suffer, nor do they feel pain.</p>

        <p>Bad news used to be good news. Well, this applied very well millennia ago. Nowadays, it doesn’t apply as well, but it still stresses us out. Why does it still stress us out? Because we haven’t changed much physiologically.</p>
        <p>So yes, bad news used to be good news, but in the past. In the present, bad news is used as a stress-inducing tool. I’m not saying that bad news doesn’t serve to inform, because the truth is, it does. But in the end, the one reporting seeks a benefit and knows that reporting in a certain way will attract more attention, and attention translates to more benefits.</p>
        <p>Why does it attract more attention? Well, as I mentioned before, thousands of years ago, we paid attention to bad news because it meant survival. If you didn’t pay attention to bad news, you were likely to die.</p>
        <p>So yes, I reiterate that bad news today, voluntarily or involuntarily, is a tool that allows for stress and benefits. And now you might ask, “But George, were the bad news really good news millennia ago?”</p>
        <p>Because this bad news provided crucial information for making decisions in risky situations, like the presence of a hungry lion patrolling near the settlement or the threat of a neighboring tribe coming to attack the village. In the face of survival, bad news is considered good news, while good news is not important and becomes irrelevant in that context.</p>
        <p>Currently, we live in a state of luxury where it is no longer necessary to constantly face threats to our survival. However, despite this reality, our physiology is predisposed to survival, generating stress and discomfort when faced with bad news.</p>
        <p>The paradox lies in the fact that, since bad news generates benefits, it spreads widely and daily, causing an increase in public attention. This attention is driven by cortisol levels and dopamine spikes, among other things, awakening the addiction monster. And this monster will end up loving bad news and then plunging us into a state of stress, which dulls our capacity for critical analysis.</p>
        <p>It’s essential to also consider that an excess of stress can trigger depression. This excess stress, caused by constant exposure to bad news, can manifest as anger, frustration, and contained aggression. A quick and cheap way to drain this anger and frustration is through physical exercise or writing, for example. The lack of an appropriate outlet for expression can lead to depression.</p>
        <p>I think it’s interesting to be aware of A) why bad news stresses us out so much, and B) why every day is a downpour of bad news.</p>
        <p>So, to summarize, bad news used to be good news. And bad news stresses us out because in the past, it was very useful for staying alive, and it was important for the mind and body to be on high alert.</p>
        <p>They rain down on us because through bad news, the media and social networks can move money from one side to another. There are lucrative interests behind the daily flow of news that shows suffering. Human suffering, of course, because here non-human animals suffer just as much or even more.</p>
        <p>Yes, a better word just came to me to describe today’s news. The bad news that reaches us daily is inflammatory news.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, this reflection highlights the importance of taking care of mental and physical health.</p>

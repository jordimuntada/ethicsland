        <p>In a previous discussion, I addressed the topic of the Paradox of Eating Meat, which poses a contradiction between not wanting to cause unnecessary harm to animals and, at the same time, consuming meat without making any effort to avoid it. This time, we will delve into the four “N’s” used to justify this paradox: natural, normal, necessary, and “Nice” (tastes good).</p>

        <p>The belief that consuming meat is natural is based on the idea that it has been a part of our diet since ancient times. However, the way we consume meat today is not natural in the primitive sense. Buying meat in markets, stores, or supermarkets, where it has been slaughtered and processed by others, is far from how our ancestors obtained their food. It’s not about cutting a leg of pork and eating it in strips or putting it in a sandwich. Our relationship with meat has evolved alongside our society and dietary practices.</p>

        <p>The argument that consuming meat is normal is based on the widespread acceptance of this practice in our society. However, normality does not necessarily imply that we should practice or accept something. Many actions and attitudes considered normal in different cultures can be unjust and immoral. It is important to question and challenge established norms when they are based on unjust practices.</p>

        <p>Another argument is the necessity of consuming meat. Fortunately, there are millions of people around the world who follow a plant-based diet and enjoy good health. Scientific evidence supports that a well-planned vegetarian or vegan diet can provide all the necessary nutrients to keep us healthy. The only barrier to adopting this lifestyle lies in the lack of information and knowledge about how to design a balanced diet.</p>

        <p>Lastly, there is mention of the gustatory satisfaction that meat provides, known as “Nice.” It is important to recognize that the pleasure of taste can be replaced by other dietary alternatives and should not be the determining factor in our dietary choices. We need to overcome the obstacles and criticism we may face when changing our dietary habits, remembering that integrity and loyalty to our moral principles have more significant long-term value.</p>

        <p>A question I want you to answer? If there's a poor family that doesn't have access to a gluten-free, animal-free vegan diet (I don't know much about your species, vegans) all that. And the dad goes to a river and manages to catch a fish or if he goes to a butcher and they give him meat, the dad is excited because he has something to feed his children. What should the dad do, or well, what do you think the dad should do??</p>


        <p>Vegan food is simple food. The "vegan" label is new and misused. For thousands of years, there have been people who have not wanted or have not been able to eat animals, they ate lentils, fruits, vegetables in general, grain, etc., and it was not called vegan. It was simply food without animals inside. “Vegan” food is not that it is cheaper per se. A plant-based (vegan) diet can be cheaper depending on how you design it.</p>

        <p>In the end, it all depends on the price of the foods you include in the diet. Then, before answering your initial question, let me tell you that I appreciate the constructive comment. I am interested in answering these types of doubts, especially when they are made with the genuine intention of clarifying concepts. If you look at my message and most of the words spread by people who try to explain the injustice suffered by animals today (for many decades as well), we never talk about a survival context, we always do it from the context of the comfortable experience that most of the population has regarding getting food. Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Morals and justice change a lot in a survival context.</p>

        <p>In fact, they almost do not exist since what we all animals seek before anything else, is to survive. To stay alive. In this context, any of us would do whatever it took to survive: from killing whoever, stealing whatever, practicing cannibalism, fighting to the death, eating whatever it took. We are not talking about pleasure, we are talking about digesting whatever it takes to survive. So, the context you propose to me is confusing.</p>

        <p>If you tell me that the dad lives in an area very rich in fish/seafood, and very poor in plants/vegetables, then it is quite clear that fishing (and I would be the first to join) is the way to survive and feed the children. If you tell me that the dad goes to the butcher and buys meat for his children, I'm not so agreeable since, without knowing the details, there will likely be markets/stores that sell vegetables, fruits, grain, nuts, and other vegetables with which to live. And it's probably cheaper than meat. Probably, you can feed more children and families in general, buying following a plant-based diet, than buying following a diet that includes meat. I hope I have answered you.</p>

        <p>In the end, what's important is to analyze each one's context. And try to be critical of the situation and the options available.</p>

        <p>Thank you very much,</p>

        <p>Jordi</p>
